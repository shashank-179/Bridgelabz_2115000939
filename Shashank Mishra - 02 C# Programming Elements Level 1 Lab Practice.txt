Sample Program 1 - Display Result:
Best Programming Practices
1. Use variables for all values, including inputs, fixed values, and results.
2. Avoid hardcoding values.
3. Use meaningful variable names.
4. Properly name programs and classes.
* String name = "Eric"; 
* double height = Convert.ToDouble(Console.ReadLine());
* double totalDistance = distanceFromToVia + distanceViaToFinalCity;
5. Maintain proper indentation.


Problem Statement: Write a program to display Sam with Roll Number 1, Percent Marks 99.99, and the result ‘P’ indicating Pass (‘P’) or Fail (‘F’).

Program Requirements:
* Use variables for all values (name, roll number, percent marks, result).
* Avoid hardcoding values.
* Follow proper naming conventions.
Code Format (C#):
// Creating a class with the name DisplayResult indicating the purpose is to display 
// result. Notice that the class name is a Noun.
using System;


class DisplayResult {
    public static void Main(string[] args) {
     
        // Create a string variable 'name' and assign value "Sam"
        string name = "Sam";
     
        // Create an int variable 'rollNumber' and assign value 1
        int rollNumber = 1;
     
        // Create a double variable 'percentMarks' and assign value 99.99
        double percentMarks = 99.99;
     
        // Create a char variable 'result' and assign value 'P' for pass
        char result = 'P';
        
        // Display the result
        Console.WriteLine($"Displaying Result:\n{name} with Roll Number {rollNumber} has Scored {percentMarks}% Marks and Result is {result}");
    }
}

The distance from Vellore to Bangalore is 211.8 km and the time taken is 4 hours 25 minutes. Compute the total distance and total time from Chennai to Bangalore.
Program Requirements:
* Use variables to hold city names and travel data.
* Calculate and display the total distance and total time.
* Proper indentation and naming conventions.
Code Format (C#):


using System;


class TravelComputation {
   public static void Main(string[] args) {


      // Create a variable 'name' to indicate the person traveling
      string name = "Eric";
      
      // Create variables 'fromCity', 'viaCity', and 'toCity' for the cities
      string fromCity = "Chennai", viaCity = "Vellore", toCity = "Bangalore";


      // Create variables for distances and times
      double distanceFromToVia = 156.6;
      int timeFromToVia = 4 * 60 + 4; // Time in minutes
      double distanceViaToFinalCity = 211.8;
      int timeViaToFinalCity = 4 * 60 + 25; // Time in minutes


      // Compute the total distance and total time
      double totalDistance = distanceFromToVia + distanceViaToFinalCity;
      int totalTime = timeFromToVia + timeViaToFinalCity;


      // Print the travel details
      Console.WriteLine($"The Total Distance travelled by {name} from {fromCity} to {toCity} via {viaCity} is {totalDistance} km and the Total Time taken is {totalTime} minutes");
