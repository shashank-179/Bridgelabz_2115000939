/*5. Using using Statement for File Handling
ðŸ’¡ Problem Statement:
Write a C# program that reads the first line of a file named "info.txt" using StreamReader.
Use using to ensure the file is automatically closed after reading.
Handle any IOException that may occur.
Expected Behavior:
If the file exists, print its first line.
If the file does not exist, catch IOException and print "Error reading file".
